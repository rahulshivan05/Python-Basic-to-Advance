# names = "Rahul, Rohit"

# find the length of names
# print(len(names))

# print(names[0:5])

# starts with x end with (x-1)

fruit = "Mango"
mangoLen = len(fruit)
# print(mangoLen)
# print(fruit[0:4])
# print(fruit[:4]) # python automatically put 0 at begginig
# print(fruit[1:4]) # including 1 but not include 4
# print(fruit[0:5]) # including 0 but not include 5
# print(fruit[0:-3])

# Python actually do like this above equation solve
# print(fruit[0:len(fruit)-3])

# solve this equation like:
# -1 => 4
# -3 => 2
# 4:2
# including 4 but not include 2
# print(fruit[-1:len(fruit)-3]) # it doesn't print anything because -1 doesn't exists

# solve equation like:
# -3 => 2
# -1 => 4
# 2:4
# including 2 but not include 4
# print(fruit[-3:-1])
